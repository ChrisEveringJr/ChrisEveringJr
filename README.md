- Hello, I’m @ChrisEveringJr
- I’m interested in learning code and becoming a software engineer. 
- My brother recently became one and it inspired me to learn code to do the same.
- I've been working in the grocery retail industry for 18 years and looking forward to joining the tech industry.
- I’m currently learning Python and enjoying it so far.
- I know I have a lot to learn and I'm excited for the challenge.
- I’m hoping to collaborate with others on projects.
- I'm still new to collaborating, and hope I can learn from others.
